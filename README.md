# FRONTEND CHALLENGE
We would like you to create a simple React program that has the following functionality:
1. Allows a user to input and submit two numbers.
2. Upon submitting, the program calculates the number of integers in a sequence between input one and two that are divisible by the number 3.
3. Finally, the user is alerted with the previously counted number of integers divisible by 3 that were calculated.

When the numbers 1 and 9 are input, there are 3 numbers divisible by 3 in the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

How you decide to go about solving the challenge is up to you, but some hard requirements include:
1. All work should be pushed to a repository on GitHub, and your submission should include a link to the repo.
2. There should be at least one test to ensure your code is working as expected.
3. Basic styling will be considered when evaluating the final product.
